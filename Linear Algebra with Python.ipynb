    "\n",
    "Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that allows you to concisely describe coordinates and interactions of planes in higher dimensions, as well as perform operations on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as an extension of algebra into an arbitrary number of dimensions. Linear Algebra is about working on linear systems of equations. Rather than working with scalars, we work with matrices and vectors. This is particularly important to the study of computer science because vectors and matrices can be used to represent data of all forms - images, text, and of course, numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Learn Linear Algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Machine Learning</b>: A lot of Machine Learning concepts are tied to linear algebra concepts. Some basic examples, PCA - eigenvalue, regression - matrix multiplication. As most ML techniques deal with high dimensional data, they are often times represented as matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Mathematical Modeling</b>: for example, if you want to capture behaviors (sales, engagement, etc.) in a mathematical model, you can use matrices to breakdown the samples into their own subgroups. This requires some basic matrix manipulation, such as matrix inversion, derivation, solving partial differential, or first order differential equations with matrices, for example. \n"

    "1. Additive Closure: If vectors u and v &isin; V, then u + v &isin; V <br>\n",
    "When we earlier stated that the vector space has all combinations of the elements in set A, one of the operations we meant by 'combinations' was <i>vector</i> addition. For example if we have two vectors in set A, let's say (4, 5) and (3, 1), then the vector space of A must have those two vectors, as well as the vector (4+3, 5+1), or `(7, 6)`. This has to be true for any two vectors in set A. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalar Closure: If u &isin; V, then &alpha; &middot; u must &isin; &Nu; for any scalar &alpha; <br>\n",
    "Recall that a scalar is a magnitude value with no direction, such as 5. For a vector space to be a vector space, that means for every vector in the original set A, that vector multiplied by any number (or constant or scalar) must be in the vector space V. \n",

    "3. Additive Identity: There exists a &middot; 0 &isin; V such that u + 0 = u for any u &isin; V <br>\n",
    "In other words, the vector space of set A must contain the zero vector.\n",

    "4. Additive Associativity: If u, v, w &isin; V, then u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w <br>\n",
    "Regardless of the order in which you add multiple vectors, their results should be the same\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Additive Inverse: If u &isin; V, then there exists a vector âˆ’u &isin; V so that u + (âˆ’u) = 0. <br>\n",
